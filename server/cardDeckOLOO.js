//Write a simple class in the language of your choice to represent a deck of cards with operations to shuffle the deck and to deal one card.

//create Deck 
  //be aware of game in top hierarchy (are we playing War? BlackJack? Uno?)
  //deck should have an origin with just deck as sole property parent in hierarchy
  //deck should have a style or type so the designer team (me,myself,I) can have fun in the future when designing UI.
  //create a shuffle function 

//With Deck Created, we can implement 'special properties' pending the game
  //create a draw one function 'popping off last card' (this sort of falls in the jungle for the banana category but most games feature a draw one behavior so I'm allowing it on a top level)

//Create a War deck!
  //create a takePile function player card is higher than dealer (r.forEach(x => {playerCards.unshift(x)});
  //create a war function (both cards drawn are equal, draw one card face down, and one card face up, winner takes pile.)
